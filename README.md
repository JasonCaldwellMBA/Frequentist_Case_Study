# Frequentist_Case_Study
The Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference and applying them to a real-world scenario. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data.

Case study demonstrates the following statistical concepts:
- The z-statistic
- The t-statistic
- The Central Limit Theorem
- Estimation of the population standard deviation and mean, from a sample
- Sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
- Calculating confidence intervals and p-values
- Hypothesis testing
